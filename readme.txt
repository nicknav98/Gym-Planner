# Gym-Planner
Turku University of Applied Sciences AP Course Project.

Collaborators are: Michalis Iona and Jerry Stigell. 

This project is an application that stores work out plans and allows registered users to create their own plans using the database of excersises. Users can customize their own plans and print out work out sheets to bring with them to the gym.

Guest users are also allowed to view workout published by members but can't customize, save or print workouts.
