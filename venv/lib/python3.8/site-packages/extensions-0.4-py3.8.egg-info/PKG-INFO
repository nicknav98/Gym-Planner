        extensions
        ==========
        
        `extensions` is a simple plugin system inspired from setuptools entry points
        [#ep]_. It allows an application to define and/or use plugins.

        How to define a plugin
        ======================
        
        A plugin can be any callable object . It has to be registered through the
        `extensions` registry.
        
        For example, let's take a simple function that calculates the average of
        some numbers, and let's save it into a file called `extensions.py` in a
        package called `myapp`::
        
            def average(*args):
                 return sum(args) / len(args)
        
        This function can be registered in the plugin system using the `register`
        function. Plugins have a **name** and belong to a **group**. For our
        example, the group can be `myapp.operator` and the name `average`::
        
            from extensions import register
        
            # usage : register(group, name, location)
            register('myapp.operator', 'average', 'myapp.extensions:average')
        
        The third parameter gives the location of the callable, with the form
        `module_name:attrs`, where `module_name` is the full name of the module,
        and `attrs` the attributes in the module.
        
        Notice that the group name includes the name of the package, which is a good
        practice to avoid collisions since the group names are global to all applications
        that use `extensions`.
        
        Using a configuration file
        ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
        
        There's another way to register your plugins by using a configuration file.
        You can write a ini-like file, using groups for sections title, and `name = location`
        for the values. 
        
        For example, if you create a `operators.cfg` file with this content::
        
            [myapp.operator]
        
            average = myapp.extensions:average
        
        You will be able to load it using ``register_file``::
        
            from extensions import register_file
        
            register_file('operators.cfg')
        
        
        This function will scan your file and register the plugins for you.
        
        
        How to use a plugin
        ===================
        
        Iterate over registered plugins
        :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
        
        `extensions` provides a `get` function that allows you to iterate over all
        registered plugins for a given group::
        
            from extensions import get
        
            for plugin in get(group='myapp.operator'):
                print plugin.name
        
        You can also give the `name` to the function::
        
            for plugin in get(group='myapp.operator', name='average'):
                 print plugin.name
        
        Or even iterate over **all** plugins::
        
            from itertools import islice
        
            for plugin in islice(get(), 5):
                print plugin.name
        
        The Plugin object
        :::::::::::::::::
        
        The objects returned by the `get` function are `Plugin` class instances.
        
        The `Plugin` class provides one method called `load`, that returns
        the registered object, so you can use it ::
        
            # let's get the plugin `average` of the group `myapp.operator`
            plugin = get(group='myapp.operator', name='average').next()
        
            # let's load it
            func = plugin.load()
        
            # let's use it now
            average = func(1, 2, 3)
        
        Plugin also provides a `name` and a `group` attribute, that corresponds
        to the `name` of the registered plugin, and to its `group`.
        
        Distribute your plugins
        =======================
        
        If you want to distribute your plugins, you just have to import the module
        that registers the plugins into your `setup.py` file::
        
            from distutils.core import setup
            from myapp import plugins  # registers the plugins
        
            setup(name='myapp', version='1.0'
                  packages=['myapp'])
        
        This will register the plugins when the package is installed by creating
        a special file called `PLUGINS` into the `.egg-info` directory created when
        your package is installed.
        
        Compatibility with setuptools entry points
        ==========================================
        
        `extensions` is fully compatible with setuptools entry points. So you can iterate 
        and use entry points defined in third-party applications that are installed 
        in your Python.
        
        If you want to iterate through setuptools entry points, use the 
        `consume_entry_points` option when you call the `get` function::
        
           plugins = get(consume_entry_points=True)
        
        This will iterate over `extensions` plugins **and** setuptools entry points.
